Objective 
1.1:
	Create a simple program (clock_gettime) that repeatedly calls the clock_gettime syscall and stores the measured values in memory and prints them to stdout
	input:
		program argurments:
			number of repetitions (no_reps)
	output:
		print to stdout the list of timestamps
1.2:
	Create a timespec utility (ts_util.h ts_util.c) and a test file for the utility (ts_test)
	functions:
	define type ts_t
	bool ts_is_equal(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 == t2?
	bool ts_is_less(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 < t2?
	ts_t ts_sub(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 -t2
	ts_to_l(ts_t *t): convert to long
	ts_printf(ts_t *t): print sec and nsec part of t
