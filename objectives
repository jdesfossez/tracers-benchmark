Objectives
1.1:
	Create a simple program (clock_gettime) that repeatedly calls the clock_gettime syscall and stores the measured values in memory and prints them to stdout
	input:
		program argurments:
			number of repetitions (no_reps)
	output:
		print to stdout the list of timestamps (sample)

1.2:
	Create a timespec utility (ts_util.h ts_util.c) and a test program for the utility (ts_test)
	define type ts_t
	functions:
		bool ts_is_equal(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 == t2?
		bool ts_is_less(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 < t2?
		ts_t ts_sub(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 -t2
		ts_to_l(ts_t *t): convert to long
		ts_printf(ts_t *t): print sec and nsec part of t

1.3:
	Create a script (set_cpus_performance.sh) to switch between performance and powersave scaling governors, if relevant.
	input:
		script argument:
			scaling governor: performance or powersave

2.1:
	Create a benchmark utility (bm_util.h bm_util.c), a test program for the utility (bm_test) and an R script (bm_test.R) to confirm test statistics
	Builds on objective:
		1.2
	functions:
		timestamps_to_intervals(ts_t *ti, ts_t *tf, long *dt, int size)
		compute_mean(long *dt, int size)
		compute_std(long *dt, int size)
		save_intervals(long *dt, int size)
		save_statistics(double mean, double std)

3.1:
	Expand clock_gettime to compute and save intervals and statistics using bm_util.c
	Builds on objectives:
		1.1 and 2.1
	output:
		intervals statistics (statistics)

4.1:
	Create a bash script (lttng.sh) that creates a lttng session, runs clock_gettime, saves the trace to "traces/" and destroys the session.
	Builds on objectives:
		3.1
	input:
		script arguments:
			sample size

4.2:
	Create a bash script (system_tap.sh) that prints a system tap script file and runs system tap on clock_gettime
	Builds on objectives:
		3.1
	input:
		script arguments:
			sample size
	ouput
		script output:
			systemp tap script (clock_gettime.stp)

4.3:
	Create a bash script (perf.sh) that runs perf on clock_gettime
	Builds on objectivs:
		3.1
	input:
		script arguments:
			sample size
	output:
		script output:
			stdout redirected to clock_gettime.out
			perf record data (perf.data/perf.data.old)

4.4:
	Create a bash script (ftrace.sh) that runs ftrace (trace-cmd) on clock_gettime
	Builds on objectives:
		3.1
	input:
		script arguments:
			sample size
	output:
		script output:
			stdout redirected to clock_gettime.out
			trace record data (trace.dat)

4.5:
	Create a bash script (lttng-snapshot.sh) that creates a lttng session in snapshot mode, runs clock_gettime and destroys the session.
	Builds on objectives:
		3.1
	input:
		script arguments:
			sample size
