Objectives
1.1:
	Create a simple program (clock_gettime) that repeatedly calls the clock_gettime syscall and stores the measured values in memory and prints them to stdout
	input:
		program argurments:
			number of repetitions (no_reps)
	output:
		print to stdout the list of timestamps
1.2:
	Create a timespec utility (ts_util.h ts_util.c) and a test program for the utility (ts_test)
	define type ts_t
	functions:
		bool ts_is_equal(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 == t2?
		bool ts_is_less(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 < t2?
		ts_t ts_sub(ts_t *t1, ts_t *t2): t1 -t2
		ts_to_l(ts_t *t): convert to long
		ts_printf(ts_t *t): print sec and nsec part of t

2.1:
	Create a benchmark utility (bm_util.h bm_util.c), a test program for the utility (bm_test) and an R script (bm_test.R) to confirm test statistics
	Builds on objective:
		1.2
	functions:
		timestamps_to_intervals(ts_t *ti, ts_t *tf, long *dt, int size)
		compute_mean(long *dt, int size)
		compute_std(long *dt, int size)
		save_intervals(long *dt, int size)
		save_statistics(double mean, double std)

3.1:
	Expand clock_gettime to compute and save intervals and statistics using bm_util.c
	Builds on objectives:
		1.1 and 2.1

4.1:
	Create a bash script that creates a lttng session, runs clock_gettime, saves the trace to "traces/" and destroys the session.
	Builds on objectives:
		3.1
