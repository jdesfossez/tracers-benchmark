ts_util: 
	Timespec utility (ts_util.h ts_util.c) and its test program (ts_test)

bm_util:
	Benchmark utility (bm_util.h bm_util.c), its test program (bm_test) and a R script (bm_test.R) to check statistics
	Dependencies:
		ts_util

getuid_pthread:
	Program that repeatedly calls clock_gettime and getuid syscalls and stores the measured timestamps in memory. Timestamps are converted to intervals and the mean and std of the sample are computed. The sample, its mean and std are saved to file. The program is running on multiple threads (pthread).

MPI_2Dexchange:
	Program that creates a 2D square lattice of linear size argv[1] and exchanges messages with nearest neighbours. The messages are randoms numbers between 0 and 9. There are arg[2] rounds of exchange.
