v1.0:
	Program that creates a 2D square lattice of linear size argv[1] and exchanges messages with nearest neighbours. The messages are randoms numbers between 0 and 9. There are arg[2] rounds of exchange.
	input:
		linear size 	argv[1]
		sample size		argv[2]
		verbose			argv[3]
	output:
		if verbose: out$rank contains sent and received messages for each round
v1.1:
	Implement proper parsing of input arguments
	input:
		linear size		-l
		sample size		-s
		verbose			-v

v2.0:
	Change input arguments to enable rectangular grids
	input:
		height		-h
		width		-w
		sample size	-s
		verbose		-v
v2.1:
	Avoid using random number generation for message creation. Use definite values based on program parameters (e.g. rank, count and msg)
