v1.0:
	Program that repeatedly calls clock_gettime and getuid syscalls and stores the measured timestamps in memory. Timestamps are converted to intervals and the mean and std of the sample are computed. The sample, its mean and std are saved to file. The program is running on multiple threads (pthread).
	Dependencies:
		ts_util v1.0
		bm_util v1.0
	input:
		arguments:
			-s sample size
			-t number of threads
	output:
		stdout: 
			pid
		file:
			sample: "sample"
			mean and std: "statistics"

v2.0:
	Add a dummy loop that increments a variable to reduce event generation rate. Add the iteration number as a new program argument.
	Dependencies:
		v1.0
	input:
		arguments:
			-d delay

v3.0:
	Add an option to enable the "set_affinity" of threads.
	Dependencies:
		v2.0
	input:
		arguments:
			-a (for "affinity")
