v1.0:
	Script to convert a rate of events per second to a number of iterations of x++
	dependencies:
		load getuid_pthread v2.0
	input: calibrate.param
		rate of events per second			event rate (events/second)
	output:
		getuid_pthread.csv
		calibrate.result:
			delay, standard error, approximate maximum rate
v1.1:
	The output file contains the delays for all input rates, such that the calibration is really complete.

v2.0:
	Rerun the calibration with the delays found to establish a baseline. Results are saved in getuid_pthread_calibrate.csv

v3.0:
	Remove hardcorded paths to other scripts, move them to the parameter file. Same for sample_size, add to param file. Echo command currently running. Add clean option
